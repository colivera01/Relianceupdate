# Reliance Project Dashboard

**Purpose:** Permanent master record for implementation progress through private beta.
**Last updated:** 2026-08-02 (Epic 1 canonical permission-gate correction)
**Update rule:** Update this dashboard after every completed epic and link the final evidence in that epic folder.

## Current Epic

**Epic 1 - Verified Permission Request**

- Planning: Approved
- Implementation: Canonical permission-gate correction deployed
- Product Owner demo: Failed gate items pass focused automated retest; manual signed-in acceptance pending
- Next action: Product Owner reruns corrected Decline/employee-block/dashboard checks, then resolves or accepts remaining recovery, retry, and SMS evidence

## Current Branch

`cursor-latest-build`

## Current Commit

Epic 1 corrected application commit: `97396da7f6c99f6cea34e7ed40b05973b548ed38`

Latest baseline reconciliation commit: `cfc53e33cd112085fa8a1cc7a14db376d1851357`

## Latest Beta Feedback Maintenance

The six issues in `Updates 7-31-26.docx` were corrected without beginning Epic 2. This checkpoint covers immediate archived-work-record refresh, a focused service-video account handoff, registration-safe policy links, idempotent manager approval, branded permission-decision email, and canonical Vendor Analytics metrics.

## Beta Readiness Progress

The Beta Readiness Checklist remains the master acceptance tracker. It is not modified by this workspace-creation task.

- Beta Ready epics: 0 of 12
- Current checklist: [Beta Readiness Master Checklist](RELIANCE_BETA_READINESS_MASTER_CHECKLIST.md)
- Current Epic snapshot: [Epic 1 Checklist Snapshot](<Epic 1 - Verified Permission Request/06_Checklist_Snapshot.md>)
- Release gate: Not ready
- Evidence rule: No checklist row becomes Beta Ready from code existence alone

## Next Epic

Epic 2 - Proof-First Platform Shell. It is not authorized to begin until recovery actions and retry operations are resolved or explicitly accepted, the Product Owner demo passes, and Epic 1 is approved closed.

## Required Update Cycle

After every completed epic:

1. Update this dashboard.
2. Update the affected epic folder.
3. Finalize the Engineering Report.
4. Finalize the UX Review.
5. Record Product Owner Demo results.
6. Record Lessons Learned.
7. Record Technical Debt.
8. Save the Checklist Snapshot.
9. Record the Git checkpoint.
